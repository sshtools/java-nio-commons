# Java NIO Commons
This projects goal is to bring together and provide implementations for a complete set of Java NIO implementations for all cloud-based and on-premise storage access. It is similar to [Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) in bringing together implementations for different systems, but instead of defining a separate access API, it uses the in-built features of Java's NIO Filesystem.

This is also NOT a Java NIO to Commons VFS bridge. If you need that, look at our other project [VFS2NIO](https://github.com/sshtools/vfs2nio).
